		 <p style="font-size:26px; font-family:fantasy"><i> Why did you choose to study CSE ? </i></p>
		   <p style="font-size:26px; font-family:fantasy" align="justify"><i>Ans : I am always curious about technology.
                   From the very beginning i wanted to know more about computer and how it works. How software runs and being created? How hardware work?
                   Moreover i love this subject very much and beyond that there is a lot of job opportunities and great Future regarding CSE.
                   And it is said that do what you love.The most important aspect of computer science is problem solving,an essential skill for life.
		   Students study the design,development and analysis of software and hardware used to solve problems in a variety of business,scientific and social contexts.
		   Because computers solve problems to server people,there is a significant human side to computer science as well.</i></p>
